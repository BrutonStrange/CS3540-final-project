Final_Project.ipynb: This notebook contains code for the SVM and PCA+K-means parts of the final project. Using the project data folder and changing the file paths to match in the first code chunk, this code should run as expected and recreate the experiments mentioned in the final project report.

Machine Learning Project Work.ipynb: This notebook contains code for decision trees, logistic regression, and some KNN models. It also contains the functions needed to load the daata into x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, assuming the paths are modified to fit the users organization.
